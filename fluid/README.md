# Fluid
This folder contains two functions that can be used to demonstrate the fluid API endpoint for the demo.  The one used on the Cisco Live show floor can be found in the `openwisk` folder, which has instructions on how to set up an [OpenWhisk installation](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk) on a VM and the function code that needs to be registered with Function Router.  It is sometimes easier to demonstrate the latency differences simply by using different AWS datacenters, so the `lambda` folder contains instructions on how to register a function with Function Router for that scenario.
