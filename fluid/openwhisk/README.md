# OpenWhisk
This folder contains two subfolders whose code and scripts work in conjunction with one another to form the fluid part of the demonstration on top of a VM residing in an ISR4K.  The `vm` folder contains instructions and scripts for setting up OpenWhisk on a VM.  The `function` folder contains an OpenWhisk compatible function written with the [Serverless Framework](http://serverless.com) and instructions for registering it with Function Router.  The `aws` folder contains instructions for how to spin up a VM on AWS using an included `Vagrantfile`.
